            Governing Law and Forum Choice. These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the ‚ÄúDispute Resolution‚Äù section below, the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and GeeBlock are not required to arbitrate will be the courts located in the Cayman Islands, and you and GeeBlock each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
          </p>
  
          <p class="title">DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>
          <p class="txt">
            Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with GeeBlock and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. <br>
            (a) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Interface (collectively, ‚ÄúDisputes‚Äù) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and GeeBlock agree to waive any rights to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.<br>
            (b) Exceptions. As limited exceptions to the section above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.<br>
            (c) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS (‚ÄúJAMS‚Äù) under the JAMS International Arbitration Rules (the ‚ÄúJAMS Rules‚Äù) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The JAMS Rules are available at jamsadr.com. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Request for Arbitration to JAMS and give notice to the other party as specified in the JAMS Rules. JAMS provides a form Request for Arbitration at jamsadr.com. The language of arbitration shall be English. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.<br>
            (d) Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules, and we won‚Äôt seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we‚Äôll pay all of our attorneys‚Äô fees and costs and won‚Äôt seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys‚Äô fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.<br>
            (e) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party‚Äôs individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.<br>
            (f) Class Action Waiver. YOU AND GEEBLOCK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  Further, if the parties‚Äô Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person‚Äôs claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void. <br>
            (g) Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions above (‚ÄúClass Action Waiver‚Äù), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.

            GeeBlock may link or otherwise provide access to products and services offered by third parties through the Service (each, ‚ÄúThird-Party Service‚Äù). Further, to use the Service, you may be required to register for Third-Party Services and/or to otherwise enable various Third-Party Services that may directly integrate with the Service. Third-Party Services are not offered by GeeBlock and GeeBlock is not responsible for any damages or losses that you might incur as a result of your use or purchase of Third-Party Services. The inclusion of Third-Party Services does not imply GeeBlock‚Äô endorsement or recommendation of them. If you access or use any Third-Party Service, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that these Terms do not apply to your access to or use of such Third-Party Service. Any engagement with a Third-Party Service is solely between you and the applicable Third-Party Service provider and is subject to such Third-Party Service‚Äôs (or Third-Party Service provider‚Äôs) own terms and conditions. As such, GeeBlock is not liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with your use of or reliance on any Third-Party Service. 
            You shall and hereby do waive any law in your jurisdiction, which says in substance: ‚ÄúA general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.‚Äù Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. You may have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
