            This Privacy Notice explains how GeeBlock Foundation (‚ÄúGeeBlock,‚Äù ‚Äúour,‚Äù ‚Äúwe,‚Äù or ‚Äúus‚Äù) collects, uses and discloses personal information in connection with our website, GeeBlock.io, the GeeBlock Community Discussion Forum, GeeBlock Docs (including whitepaper.GeeBlock.io), and all related services (collectively the ‚Äúservices‚Äù). <br>
            This Privacy Notice is not a contract and does not create any legal rights or obligations. 
          </p>

          <p class="title">OUR COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
          <p class="txt">
            Sometimes we collect personal information automatically when an individual interacts with our services, and sometimes we collect personal information directly from individuals. At times, we may collect personal information about an individual from other sources and third parties, even before our first direct interaction. 
          </p>

          <p class="title">PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED DIRECTLY FROM INDIVIDUALS</p>
          <p class="txt">
            We may collect the following personal information individuals provide in connection with our services: <br>
            Contact Information, including name, email address, social media handles, and communication preferences. <br>
            Referral Information, including information about friends and family an individual would like to refer to our services. <br>
            Inquiry Information, including information provided in custom messages sent through our services (including web forms and the GeeBlock Assistant feature) or provided directly to a member of our team. <br>
            Account Information, including username, profile pictures, profile description, general location, trust level, and join date. <br>
            GeeBlock Community Discussion Forum Information, including number of days visited, topics and posts created, topics viewed, posts read, time spent reading, likes given and received, badges, and community preferences. 
            <br><br>
            Where an individual chooses to contact us, we may need additional information to fulfill the request or respond to inquiries. We may provide additional privacy-related information where the scope of the inquiry/request and/or personal information we require fall outside the scope of this Privacy Notice. In that case, the additional privacy notice will govern how we may process the information provided at that time. 
          </p>

          <p class="title">PERSONAL INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED</p>
          <p class="txt">
            As is true of most digital platforms, we and our third-party providers may also collect personal information from an individual‚Äôs device, browsing actions, and site usage patterns automatically when visiting or interacting with our services, which may include: <br>
            Log Data, such as internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, browser ID, the URL entered and the referring page/campaign, date/time of visit, the time spent on our services, and any errors that may occur during the visit to our services.<br>
            Analytics Data, such as the electronic path taken to our services, through our services, and when exiting our services, as well as usage and activity on our services.<br>
            Location Data, such as general geographic location based on the log data we or our third-party providers collect. <br>
            For information about our and our third-party providers‚Äô use of cookies and related technologies to collect information automatically, and any choices individuals may have in relation to its collection, please review the Cookies and Related Technologies section below. 
          </p>

          <p class="title">PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTIES AND OTHER SOURCES</p>
          <p class="txt">
            We also obtain personal information from third parties, which we often combine with personal information we collect either automatically or directly from an individual. <br>
            We may receive the same categories of personal information as described above from the following third parties:
            Referrals: We offer a referral service that allows an individual to tell one of their friends or a member of their family about our services by forwarding certain marketing communications and/or emails to the friend or family member they believe may be interested in our products or services. We use personal information collected in connection with these referral services to communicate with the friend or family member being referred and to provide the referring individual any benefits, incentives and/or rewards they may be eligible for as a result of their referral. <br>
            Social Media: If an individual chooses to interact with us on social media, we may collect personal information about them from their social media account that they make public. We use personal information collected in connection with their social media account to communicate with them, better understand their interests and preferences, and better understand our user base in the aggregate.<br>
            Identity Verification Providers: In certain circumstances, we may engage third-party identity verification providers to help us verify the identity of a specific individual with whom we are interacting. This information is used primarily for purposes of preventing fraud. <br>
            Event, Promotion and Other Business Partners: We may from time to time offer opportunities for individuals to take part in events or promotions, or obtain services provided in connection with a third-party business partner. Our event, promotion, and other business partners may collect or share personal information with us in connection with the relevant event, promotion or service. For example, we may receive personal information from third-party business partners that help foster the GeeBlock community in order to identify community members eligible for benefits in relation to a promotion. <br>
            Data Analytics Providers: We rely on third-party providers to help us collect analytics relating to our services and user base. These data analytics providers often collect personal information directly from individuals and share some or all of this information with us in connection with their analytics services. 
            Other Service Providers: Other service providers that perform services solely on our behalf, such as website hosting, customer service, and marketing providers, collect personal information and often share some or all of this information with us in connection with their services. <br>
            Affiliates: We may receive personal information from other companies owned or controlled by GeeBlock Foundation, and other companies owning or under common ownership with GeeBlock Foundation, particularly when we collaborate in providing services.<br>
            GeeBlock Community Discussion Forum Participants: We may receive personal information from other participants in the GeeBlock Community Discussion Forum to help support your interaction with the GeeBlock community.<br>
            Information Providers: We may from time to time obtain information from third-party information providers to correct or supplement personal information we collect. For example, we may obtain updated contact information from third-party information providers to connect with an individual who may be interested in our services. 
            Publicly Available Sources: We collect personal information about individuals that we do not otherwise have, such as contact information or an individual‚Äôs interest in our services, from publicly available sources. We may combine this information with the information we collect from an individual directly.<br>
            Inferences: We may generate inferences or predictions about individuals and their interests and preferences based on the other personal information we collect and the interactions we have with the individuals.
          </p>

          <p class="title">OUR COLLECTION OF BLOCKCHAIN INFORMATION</p>
